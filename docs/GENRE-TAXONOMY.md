# Genre taxonomy

The curated genre tree used by BookTracker, plus where each branch came from.

For the field-level details of the `Genre` entity (uniqueness, hierarchy mechanics, selection auto-cascading) see [`DATA-DICTIONARY.md`](DATA-DICTIONARY.md) §Genre.

## Source of truth

The seed list lives in [`BookTracker.Data/Models/GenreSeed.cs`](../BookTracker.Data/Models/GenreSeed.cs) as a static `IReadOnlyList<Entry>` of `(Name, ParentName)` records. Each migration that extends the taxonomy uses this list to insert new rows — the file is the canonical taxonomy, the DB is the runtime reflection of it.

Branch reference: [fictionary.co/journal/book-genres](https://fictionary.co/journal/book-genres/) — the structural inspiration for the fiction branches.

## Provenance

| Branch | Added by | Migration |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Fantasy + Romance + Mystery sub-trees + most top-level fiction | Initial seed | `20260414111237_AddGenreHierarchyAndSeed` |
| Horror sub-genres (Cthulhu Mythos / Vampire / Zombie) | Follow-up seed | `20260419110101_SeedHorrorSubGenres` |
| Reference + Art + Religion & Spirituality (all three branches and their sub-genres) | Non-fiction starter set | `20260422090308_SeedNonFictionReferenceArtReligion` |
| Science Fiction sub-tree (Hard SF / Space Opera / Cyberpunk / Military SF / Time Travel / First Contact / Post-Apocalyptic / Dystopian SF / Alternate History / Young Adult SF) + Horror sub-tree extension (Cosmic Horror / Gothic Horror / Supernatural / Psychological Horror / Splatterpunk / Folk Horror / Body Horror) | Genre-restructure pass (PR 1) | `20260516233131_SeedGenreExpansion` |
| `Graphic Novels` + `Short Story Collections` removed from the tree (moved to `format:*` Tag convention); `format:graphic-novel` + `format:short-stories` Tag rows seeded | Genre-restructure pass (PR 2) | `20260517041346_RemoveFormatGenres` |
| Reference sub-genres (Popular Science / Memoir / Philosophy) + top-level Poetry | Genre-restructure round 2 (this PR) | `20260522023150_SeedNonFictionSubGenresAndPoetry` |

User-added genres (created via the Add page typeahead's free-text fall-through, if that surface allows it — currently the picker is closed-list against `GenreSeed.All`) would *not* be in `GenreSeed.cs` but would live in the DB. If you see a Genre row in the snapshot that's not in this file, it's either a stale row from a withdrawn seed, an out-of-band insert, or this file is behind. As of this writing, the picker is closed-list, so the DB and `GenreSeed.cs` should match exactly.

## Branches *not* yet seeded

The original comment in `GenreSeed.cs` flags non-fiction expansion as deliberate future work — branches that are missing today and would be the obvious next additions:

- **History** (Ancient / Medieval / Modern / Military / Local-regional)
- **Biography** (Autobiography / Authorised / Unauthorised — `Memoir` was seeded under Reference in the 2026-05-22 round-2 pass; a sibling `Biography` branch may earn its keep if the corpus demands the distinction)
- **Science** (Mathematics / Physics / Biology / Earth-science / etc. — `Popular Science` was seeded under Reference in the 2026-05-22 round-2 pass as the catch-all for trade-press science writing)
- **Cookery / Cookbooks** (currently no home — cookbooks tagged today go under Reference or unclassified)
- **Travel writing**
- **Essays / Letters**
- **Self-help / Productivity**
- **Politics / Current affairs**

If a brainstorming session proposes adding a branch, the addition is:
1. New `new("Branch Name", null)` (or with parent) entries in `GenreSeed.cs`.
2. A new EF migration following the pattern of `SeedNonFictionReferenceArtReligion.cs` — `INSERT` rows into `Genres` with explicit IDs continuing from the last seeded row.
3. No code change in the picker — it loads from `Genres` at runtime.

## Conventions worth remembering for restructuring discussions

- **Selecting a sub-genre auto-selects its parent** on the Add page. Aggregations should respect this — a Work tagged "Urban Fantasy" *is* in the Fantasy bucket whether or not Fantasy was also explicitly selected.
- **Genre name uniqueness is global**, not scoped to a parent. You can't have "Romance > Historical" and "Mystery > Historical" — name it "Historical Romance" / "Historical Mystery" instead (as the current tree does).
- **Hierarchy is single-parent** — a sub-genre belongs to exactly one parent. "Romantasy" is parented under Romance, not also under Fantasy, even though it sits on the boundary.
- **Single-Work books inherit Genre via their Work.** A novel is "Fantasy" because the Work is; a compendium's Book-level summary has to aggregate Genres across all contained Works.
- **`BookCategory` (`Fiction` / `NonFiction`) is orthogonal to genre** — *Biographical Fiction* is `Category = Fiction` but genre-tagged on the Work. There's no enforced consistency check between `BookCategory` and Genre parentage today.

## Open questions worth flagging in restructuring brainstorms

1. **Where do cookbooks go?** Currently nowhere clean — Reference subtree was scoped to dictionaries / encyclopaedias / atlases / field guides / style guides / language learning. A new top-level "Cookery" or sub-branch under Reference would resolve it. Surfaced because reference book capture is the next planned wave (TODO #51).
2. ~~**Sci-fi has no sub-genres yet** despite being one of the largest fiction branches.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17** by `SeedGenreExpansion` — 10 sub-genres added including `Dystopian SF`. The existing top-level `Dystopian` is kept for non-SF dystopias (literary, near-future thriller) per the genre-restructure brief.
3. ~~**`Short Story Collections` as a top-level genre is structurally odd** — it's a *format* indicator, not a genre.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17** by `RemoveFormatGenres` — moved to `format:short-stories` Tag on the Book. Constituent Works keep their thematic genre (e.g. Mystery for a Christie collection).
4. ~~**`Graphic Novels` similar concern** — format or genre? Currently treated as genre.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17** by `RemoveFormatGenres` — moved to `format:graphic-novel` Tag on the Book.
5. **`Romantasy` vs `Paranormal Fantasy` vs `Paranormal Romance`** — three sub-genres at the boundary that may overlap in practice. Worth a usage scan: are all three actively used? Do any captures land in two of them simultaneously?
